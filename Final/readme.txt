# Final-Web-Project






To use this project, follow the guidelines listed below:



1.  You must have Python 3 and Django installed on the computer you will use as the server. Also install the module "localflavor" with pip.


2.  Copy the entire directory, as is, onto the server computer.


3.  From the .../Final directory (the one that has the manage.py file in it),  open a command prompt and run 'py manage.py runserver' 
    to start the project.


4.  On the same computer, open a web browser and navigate to '127.0.0.1:8000' to view the website.


5.  Django has and admin site that allows you to work 'behind the scenes' of the website.  This allows the user to take care of admin features like creating users, 
    working directly with the database, etc.  To access the admin site, navigate to '127.0.0.1:8000/admin/' and log in with the credentials "guest"/"finalexam".
