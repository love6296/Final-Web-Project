# Final-Web-Project


To use this project, follow the guidelines listed below:

1.  You must have Python 3 and Django installed on the computer you will use as the server.
2.  Copy the entire directory, as is, onto the server computer.
3.  From the .../Final directory (the one that has the manage.py file in it),  open a command prompt and run 'py manage.py runserver' 
    to start the project.
4.  On the same computer, open a web browser and navigate to '127.0.0.1:8000' to view the website.
5.  You will be asked for login credentials.  To create your own, from the same command prompt as before, stop the server (Ctrl-C) and run
    'py manage.py createsuperuser'.  You will prompted to enter a user name, password, and email.  Once done, restart the server as before.
    You will then be able to log into the website.
